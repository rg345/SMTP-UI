# SMTP UI

SMTP UI is a secure, privacy-focused email management system built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to manage multiple SMTP configurations, compose and send emails (with attachments), and view detailed logs of sent emailsâ€”all from a modern, user-friendly web interface. All email credentials and data are stored securely and processed locally, ensuring user privacy.
